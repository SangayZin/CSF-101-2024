# Encapsulation: The Character class puts everything about a character (name, health, items)
# and what they can do (like describe themselves, take damage, pick up items) in one place.

# Inheritance: The Hero class gets everything from the Character class (like name, health, and actions)
# without needing to write the same code again.
class Hero(Character):
    # This method lets the hero heal by adding more health
    def heal(self, amount):

# Inheritance: The Villain class gets everything from the Character class, like name, health, and actions, without needing to write that code again.

    # Polymorphism: Overriding the describe method to give a more evil description.
    def describe(self):

# Abstraction: The Adventure class provides a simple interface to manage scenes
# and character interactions, hiding the complex details.
